           <span><kbd>Grasshopper(aka Hopper) is a senior boy with personality plus. He is a small, intelligent escape artist that needs a secure yard to play in. He loves to cuddle and will ensure than your lap is never empty and that you never suffer from the lack of doggy kisses. He will make himself at home and assumes that everyone loves him and wants to be up close. Hopper needs to work on boundaries and manners but we understand why he hasn't learned them... he is very difficult to resist! Someone with a fenced yard, no small male dogs and older children would ideal for Hopper. Hopper does well female dogs and large male dogs but what he really loves are treats, chewies and golf cart rides!

He would be a perfect addition for an experienced JRT owner.

Grasshopper is being lovingly fostered near Huntsville ON.

            <kbd>Meet DJ
German Shepherd Mix I 2 years old I Male I 105 lbs

Temperament: Sweet, loving, loyal.
Activity Level: High!
Vetting: Core vaccines (dhpp and rabies), neutered, microchipped, dewormed, fecal - negative, 4dx bloodwork - negative, heartworm - negative, full blood panel - normal, skin cytology originally showed a fungal and skin infection which has been cured, on tick/heartworm and flea prevention. DJ came in severely underweight with a horrendous skin and fungal infection where there was also a lot of hair loss. After a regime of medicated baths, lots of medication, multiple vet visits, and a change in diet DJ has flourished. Please note that he is eating kangaroo kibble, kangaroo treats and needs to have a medicated bath once a week. He is on 1 allergy meds/day and is currently doing very well by restricting diet to only kangaroo and having baths. He goes to the vets every 6 weeks or so to have his anal glands drained.
Housebroken? Yes!
Good with Dogs? He has 2 dog friends at the park (both medium size), he plays off leash with and is always playful and a little timid, he is never aggressive. He does seem to show a little aggression toward small dogs though.
Good with Cats? No.
Good with Children? Unknown, but gets scared of kids when they are loud if they were passed on a walk, so would say no kids is best!
Any noted prey drive? Yes! He will go after squirrels, birds and cats.
How do they respond to the outdoors? He loves the outdoors, but prefers quieter neighbourhoods. He loves to run. He will go to the beach but won’t go into the water!
Busy Streets? Does not like busy streets, at all! He doesn’t mind the cars, or the people so much. But he gets very scared by loud noises! Specifically by skateboards, rollerbladers, groups of loud kids.
What type of exercise do they get and how much? He goes on daily 5km runs to the water, plus a few walks in the neighbourhood.
How active are they? Extremely high energy and very active! He can out-run people, and is very hyper in the house.
Crate-Trained? Yes, he is crate trained! He is left uncrated if leaving the house for less than 4 hours, but anything more than that he is crated.
Walks well on leash? He is great on a leash! Can get hyper and pull but is pretty good at listening to commands! If he gets “spooked” while on a walk (which happens much less now - but is caused by sudden loud noises like construction or alot of trucks going by), he will however still pull and just want to go home.
How do they respond to commands? He responds very well to commands.
Are they vocal? If so, in what way? Yes! Mostly inside! He will bark when people come and go from the house. If the sound of cars or people outside wake him up in the night, he will bark.
How do they handle transit or car transportation? He behaves in cars, however gets extremely car sick when in a car for over 30 minutes. Car rides are limited to just going to the vets.
*DJ’s bio may change as we get to know him better.
*We cannot guarantee breed mix nor age.
*Comes with 6 weeks of pet insurance totalling $500.

New year, new DJ! This playful boy has improved greatly with his foster, learning and responding well to commands, and can be left alone for a short period of time now. This DJ will have your heart spinning. DJ is a super sweet dog who is very cuddly and will just want to spend all his time with you. He is highly energetic and loves to run around outside and is the happiest when he can run around off leash with his toys. This hyper boy loves to play with people and can get a little nippy just like a puppy, however he’s usually very gentle. He’s a big hyper boy who likes to play a little rough, but never takes it too far. He is a chewer and more training in this area would benefit him. DJ can be left alone without being crated for up to 4 hours now. Lots of exercise, toys to keep him occupied and busy, turn this active boy into a big sleepy cuddly puppy.

He would do well with a highly active family with no kids and no other pets in a quiet neighbourhood or rural property with a fenced-in backyard for him to play and run around in. He benefits from going on a run or a long walk in the morning to use up some of his extra energy. This big cuddler would like a family who is comfortable having him sleep in their bed, hang out on the couch and even in your lap! He loves people so much, at least one person who works from home is optimal for him. DJ had a severe skin infection and possibly food allergies so is on a restricted diet of eating only Kangaroo kibble and Kangaroo treats, and has improved greatly on this diet. If you think you can give this very sweet boy DJ, a loving home please contact adopt@covetedcanines.org.      COAT LENGTH

Xuli is looking for her SPR furever home. Her and her daughter Jasmine came to SPR on Feb 13 all the way from Oman! Xuli was previously a stray who happened upon the right house who took her in when she was pregnant with Jasmine! They were both fosted together for about a year before they were able to make their trip to find their furever homes here in Canada.

She is kid tested but gets easily startled so she will need a home who understands implementing boundaries with this child and animals. She is not cat tested and shows some pray drive. After a lot of time and effort with her SPR foster Xuli has been able to shine and is come now comfortable around other dogs when properly introduced but her new owner will need to understand the decompression period 3-3-3 rule as it's going to take some time for her to shine in a new environment but once she trust you, you will have a BFF for life!

Xuli knows how to sit, lie down, leave it and what no means, she is not crate trained but it is something that we are working on. She is looking for someone who is very active like her daughter Jasmine. She loves to walk and go on runs! A home with another dog that isn't too needy and won't be all over her would be amazing as she does thrive around a friend!     HOUSE-TRAINED

----------------------------------
Yisoon was rescued with her mom and siblings from an owner who raised them to sell to the meat trade as supplementary income. They were fed only once every few days, which consisted of scraps that often froze in the winter, making it impossible for them to eat.

After her rescue, Yisoon and her siblings lived in a boarding house with their mom (who is undergoing heartworm treatment) and about 80 other dogs. They are typical puppies who are playful, social, and friendly with everyone they meet. Recently, they flew to Toronto to find their forever homes.

Yisoon is settling well in her foster home in Toronto. She was a little shy to begin with, but it didn't take her long to settle in and open up. She is curious, food motivated, and likes to play with toys. Yisoon does well with other dogs and gains confidence being around them, but also likes to be in charge. She would likely do best with a friendly male dog or as the only dog.

Her ideal home is with people who have the time to devote to training and socializing a puppy. She would likely do best with an active family who enjoy walks and hikes, once given the chance to settle in and get used to her leash and harness.

Currently, she is in Toronto.

I'm Meatball, and I'm new here.
Let's be honest-I'm an older guy, although I prefer to be referred to as ""aged to perfection""
My ears and eyes are not as sharp as they once were but I enjoy many pastimes, including basketball, charades and extreme chipmunk hunting.
My favourite way to wind down after a long day of napping, is to roll around in my Foster family's Flower beds and be one with the dirt.

Hello there (said in a deep Morgan Freeman voice)

My name is Bear and I am new to HBR and am visiting for awhile at my foster home just waiting to meet up with you later on

Some say I am like a ""grumpy old man"" but I just cherish my sleep, and right now I am not a fan of all this snow! I don't have a ton of energy for long walks and such but I can move pretty fast when it's time for dinner.

I can put up with lots of pets and scratches, especially my butt and I like a little game of tug with my rope once in awhile.

Hello!
My name is Maia (8 years old) , I am new to Homeward Bound rescue. Although I can be very wary of strangers, I warm up VERY quickly. I am a people dog; I LOVE my people!! I love to nap and to snuggle, and if you leave the room, I need to come to make sure you're ok. I love to chew on bones, but I need softer ones because I recently had to have most of my teeth removed. I have healed up well, and very quickly! My foster mom says I take my medications very well, I love it, because it means I get CHEESE!! I am also loving this sunshine and going for lots of walks, I may have little legs but I am a trouper! After a nice long walk my favourite thing is to lay on my humans lap and take a nice long nap. My apologies for the snoring *blush*. My ideal forever home would be with someone I can be with all the time because I will just love you soooooo much. We can go for longs walks, cuddle, and get LOTS of belly rubs (they are my favourite). I cannot wait to meet you!

Hi, My name is Kerri ( I am just over 8 years old)

I love following my foster mom around everywhere, it can be quite tiring some days. I love my belly rubs, they are the best but I will take any kind of affection. If no one is noticing me I will stand up on my back legs and beg for attention, I have no shame. I will also use this tactic for treats or if I need to go out for a pee. I am very health conscious and only like veggies as my treats. Cauliflower, watermelon, carrots, broccoli and cucumber are my favs.
I love my short walks a couple times a day. I don't pay much attention to other dogs on my walk, but do like to say hello to the people. I will definitely let you know if someone is approaching the door or walking past the house, I'm a good guard dog like that and you can be sure that I will not let any of those pesky squirrels into your yard. I can't wait to meet my forever family!


Perfect home for Kerri

-detached as she likes to bark
- dog savvy kids over the age of 12 ( no young kids please)
- an active family is not a good fit
-she would prefer being the only pet but will tolerate other pets

For more info about the dog, adoption process, or adoption application, please follow the link below. Thank you.
https://www.freekoreandogs.org/adopt/happy/

----------
Happy was rescued from a dog meat farm and currently lives with a foster in Ottawa, ON.

Apart from being  happy girl like her name suggests, she has a balanced energy - equally loving her walks, playing with her frisbee outside,  or simply just hanging out at home and laying around watching TV with her humans. True to her breed, she is very loyal to her humans, and takes time to cautiously get to know new people and situations (although she is never aggressive). She is food motivated, which certainly helps win her over faster!

Happy has experience living with cats whom she shares her bed and water dish with after getting used to each other. She is also good with other dogs, but prefers dogs who are more submissive and calm than dominant in personality. She is also potty trained and walks well on leash (after she has been able to do her business, which she only likes to do on walks).

Happy would make a wonderful companion. She would prefer to be in a quieter neighborhood and laidback household (vs. the hustle and bustle of the busy city) with people who enjoy the outdoors as much as she does (although she does prefer the winter to summer). Having a fenced in yard would be a bonus to her dream home.

------

Available for Adoption in Toronto/GTA or Surrounding areas within ON where we have volunteers in place.

My name is Touffy, I'm a Havanese Maltese x

I'm a sweet, loving dog of about 2 years old. I am good with other small dogs but I might prefer having my people only to myself.

I'm a very well tempered dog who loves her people very much. I'm like the "perfect" dog and my foster parents commented on how good I am.

I'm 12.5 lbs and would make a great addition to any home. So loving, so sweet and my smile? I'm like that all the time ?

Please READ my listing. If you fit the criteria listed below, please contact us at info@snookiessociety.com Applicants meeting the criteria will be sent an adoption application. We no longer have our forms listed on our website.

Please Read my wish/must have list:

-A fully fenced yard would be nice but not a must
-People with a flexible work schedule
-Rescue dog experience
-A family who raised their own dogs
-A vet reference is required
-Adult home. We don't know if Touffy is good with young kids (children over 12+ is okay)

Thank you.
